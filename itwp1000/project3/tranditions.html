                <p class="major">The main Chinese New Year activities include 1) putting up decorations, 2) offering
                    sacrifices to ancestors, 3) eating reunion dinner with family on New Year's Eve, 4) giving red
                    envelopes and other gifts, 5) firecrackers and fireworks, and 6) watching lion and dragon dances.

                            <p>People give their houses a thorough cleaning before the Spring Festival, which symbolizes
                                sweeping away the bad luck of the preceding year and making their homes ready to receive
                                good luck.
                                Red is the main color for the festival, as red is believed to be an auspicious color for
                                the Lunar New Year, denoting prosperity and energy — which ward off evil spirits and
                                negativity. Red lanterns hang in streets; red couplets and New Year pictures are pasted
                                on doors. </p>

                            <p>Honoring the dead is a Chinese New Year's tradition that's kept to the word. Many Chinese
                                people visit ancestors' graves on the day before the Chinese New Year's day, offer
                                sacrifices to ancestors before the reunion dinner (to show that they are letting their
                                ancestors "eat" first), and add an extra glass and place it at the dinner table on New
                                Year's eve. </p>

                            <p>Chinese New Year (Lunar New Year) is a time for families to be together. Chinese New
                                Year's Eve is the most important time. Wherever they are, people are expected to be home
                                to celebrate the festival with their families. The Chinese New Year's Eve dinner is
                                called 'reunion dinner'. Big families of several generations sit around round tables and
                                enjoy the food and time together.</p>

                        <dd>
                            <p>The most common gifts are red envelopes (or red packets, lìshì or lai see in Cantonese).
                                Red envelopes have money in, and are often given to children and (retired) seniors.
                                The red envelope (money) is called ya sui qian (压岁钱 /yaa sway chyen/), which means
                                'suppressing Sui [the demon]money'. Those who receive a red envelope are wished another
                                safe and peaceful year. </p>

                                areas, setting off firecrackers and fireworks is an indispensable festive activity. It
                                is a way to scare away the evil and welcome the new year's arrival.
                                Billions of fireworks go up in China at 12 am and in the first minutes of Chinese New
                                Year, the most anywhere at any time of year.</p>

                            <p>Lion dances and dragon dances are widely seen in China and Chinatowns in many Western
                                countries during the Lunar New Year period. They are performed to bring prosperity and
                                good luck for the upcoming year or event.
                                There are more Chinese New Year traditions and customs, such as wearing new clothes,
