                <h1>Zodiac Animals</h1>
                <p class="major">Each year in the Lunar calendar is represented by one of 12 zodiac animals included in
                    the cycle of
                    12 stations or “signs” along the apparent path of the sun through the cosmos. In addition to the
                    animals, five elements of earth, water, fire, wood and metal are also mapped onto the traditional
                    lunar calendar. Each year is associated with an animal that corresponds to an element.</p>
                <p class="major">The Chinese zodiac, or Sheng Xiao (生肖), is a repeating 12-year cycle of animal signs and their
                    ascribed attributes, based on the lunar calendar. In order, the zodiac animals are: Rat, Ox, Tiger,
                    Rabbit, Dragon, Snake, Horse, Goat, Monkey, Rooster, Dog, Pig.</p>

                            <h3>Rat</h3>
                            <p>People born in the year of the Rat like saving and collecting. They never have hard times
                                financially and live organized lives. If you receive a valuable gift from a Rat, know
                                that
                                he thinks highly of you, because he doesn't usually like opening his wallet for others.
                                Rats
                                don't look for praise and recognition. They are very sensitive and know when there is
                                trouble. When they do take risks, they're usually successful..</p>

                            <h3>Ox</h3>
                            <p>People born in the year of the Ox are hard workers and have a strong sense of
                                responsibility.
                                Even if they run into difficulty during work, they'll persevere through. They aren't
                                very
                                romantic, but are patient and would never force themselves onto someone who doesn't like
                                them. They are usually quiet and keep their emotions bottled up inside. It's hard for
                                others
                                to understand them. When they do lose their temper, it's like an explosion and can drive
                                others away.</p>

                            <h3>Tiger</h3>
                            <p>People born in the year of the Tiger are independent and have high self-esteem. They
                                enjoy
                                being the leader and protector of average people. They love justice and never back down
                                in
                                an argument. Recklessness is their biggest weakness, causing them to fail. However, they
                                never truly fail. Tigers will always find a way to stand back up and succeed in the end.

                            <p>People born in the year of the Rabbit are gentle, quiet and polite. They are patient,
                                intelligent and chic. Their sense of responsibility and attention to detail lead to
                                great career success. They take love seriously as well, and would never fall for someone
                                easily. If they find the right person, they'll love them to the end of the world and
                                back.</p>

                            <h3>Dragon</h3>
                            <p>People born in the year of the Dragon have hearts full of adventure and romance. It's
                                hard for people to understand a Dragon's mysterious personality. At the same time, they
                                are indifferent to things the average person worries about. They may seem lazy, but once
                                they decide to do something, they'll be more ambitious and vigorous than anyone else.

                            <p>People born in the year of the Snake are idealists. On the outside, they may seem cold
                                but,
                                deep inside, they are warm and enthusiastic. Their desire of exclusive ownership is very
                                fierce. It irks them if they can't fully understand someone. Snakes are devoted and
                                determined, but their worst enemy is laziness.</p>

                                and
                                energetic, pushing themselves forward. Their biggest desire is to have the freedom to do
                                what they like and be able to express themselves. However, they also have various
                                negative
                                traits. Horses are bad at keeping secrets and lose interest quickly.</p>

                            <p>People born in the year of the Goat have a pure and kind heart. They'd rather suffer
                                silently
                                than argue and ruin someone else's mood. However, even in silence, they still hold onto
                                their own opinion. In regards to their passions, they will do anything possible to
                                fulfill
                                their wishes. Though kind, Goats have tricks up their sleeves as well. They are skilled
                                at
                                using soft power, able to patiently and politely persuade others into their favor.</p>

                            <p>People born in the year of the Monkey do things based on interest. If it's something they
                                don't quite care for, they'll do the work sloppily. If it something they're interested
                                in,
                                they'll put their entire heart into it and work until they succeed. They live a long
                                life
                                full of energy and curiosity for the world. Monkeys also value relationships. However,
                                spoiling children may be their weakness.</p>

                                feeling. They have quick reactions and high EQ. They make great friends, although some
                                are
                                cunning. Roosters are creative and talented in the arts, although few find a career in
                                that
                                field. They have foresight and plan everything carefully.</p>

                                family. Most of them are wealthy. Their only obvious fault is that they lose their
                                temper
