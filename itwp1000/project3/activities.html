                <h1>Celebration Activities Calender</h1>
                <p class="major">The Chinese New Year, or Spring Festival, has more than 4,000 years of history and is
                    the longest holiday of the year. In the 21st century, the national holiday begins on the first of
                    the Lunar Calendar and lasts until the 15th of the first month. In 2022, Chinese New Year begins on
                    February 1st and ends February 15th with the Lantern Festival.

                    In China, all stores are closed during the first five days of the Spring Festival, with some not
                    opening until the very end. People must stock up on New Year supplies (年货 / nian huo) beforehand and
                    many begin on the Laba Festival. Kitchens will also show the first signs of Spring Festival dishes
                    with the preparation of cured meat, salted fish and other preserved food.</p>

                        <h2>The Laba Festival</h2>

                    <p>
                        However, in the traditional sense, the Laba Festival (腊八 / Làbā jié) of the lunar December
                        (January 10th, 2022) marks the beginning of the Spring Festival. Memorial ceremonies are held on
                        this day to pray to ancestors and gods (such as door gods) for fortune and a successful harvest.
                        Though paganist in nature, the festival has become integrated into religions such as Daoism and
                        Buddhism.

                        The main food for this festival is the Laba porridge (腊八粥 / Làbā zhōu). It includes seven types
                        of grains, such as red bean, red dates and husked rice. There are many different myths regarding
                        this porridge, but all teach the lesson of being grateful and not taking what you have for
                        granted.
