    <h2>22 Lyrics</h2>
    <i>by Taylor Swift</i>
    <br>
    <p><a id="lyrics1"></a>
        It feels like a perfect night<br>
        To dress up like hipsters<br>
        And make fun of our exes, uh-uh, uh-uh<br>
        It feels like a perfect night<br>
        For breakfast at midnight<br>
        To fall in love with strangers, uh-uh, uh-uh<br>
    </p>
    <p><a id="lyrics2"></a>
        Yeah<br>
        We're happy, free, confused, and lonely at the same time<br>
        It's miserable and magical, oh, yeah<br>
        Tonight's the night when we forget about the deadlines<br>
        It's time, oh-oh<br>
    </p>
    <p><a id="lyrics3"></a>
        I don't know about you, but I'm feeling 22<br>
        Everything will be alright if you keep me next to you<br>
        You don't know about me, but I'll bet you want to<br>
        Everything will be alright if we just keep dancing like we're<br>
        22, 22<br>
    </p>
    <p><a id="lyrics4"></a>
        It seems like one of those nights<br>
        This place is too crowded<br>
        Too many cool kids, uh-uh, uh-uh<br>
        (Who's Taylor Swift, anyway? Ew)<br>
        It seems like one of those nights<br>
        We ditch the whole scene<br>
        And end up dreaming<br>
        Instead of sleeping<br>
    </p>
    <p><a id="lyrics5"></a>
        Yeah<br>
        We're happy, free, confused, and lonely in the best way<br>
        It's miserable and magical, oh, yeah<br>
        Tonight's the night when we forget about the heartbreaks<br>
        It's time, oh-oh<br>
    </p>
    <p><a id="lyrics6"></a>
        I don't know about you, but I'm feeling 22<br>
        Everything will be alright (Ooh) if you keep me next to you<br>
        You don't know about me, but I'll bet you want to<br>
        Everything will be alright if (Alright)<br>
        We just keep dancing like we're 22 (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)<br>
        22 (I don't know about you)<br>
        22, 22<br>
    </p>
    <p><a id="lyrics7"></a>
        It feels like one of those nights<br>
        We ditch the whole scene<br>
        It feels like one of those nights<br>
        We won't be sleeping<br>
        It feels like one of those nights<br>
        You look like bad news<br>
        I gotta have you<br>
        I gotta have you<br>
        Ooh, ooh, yeah<br>
    </p>
    <p><a id="lyrics8"></a>
        (Hey!)<br>
        I don't know about you, but I'm feeling 22<br>
        Everything will be alright if (Ooh) you keep me next to you<br>
        You don't know about me, but I'll bet you want to<br>
        Everything will be alright if we just keep dancing like we're<br>
        22 (Whoa, oh)<br>
        22 (Dancing like)<br>
        22 (Yeah, yeah), 22, (Yeah, yeah, yeah)<br>
    </p>
    <p><a id="lyrics9"></a>
        It feels like one of those nights<br>
        We ditch the whole scene<br>
        It feels like one of those nights<br>
        We won't be sleeping<br>
        It feels like one of those nights<br>
        You look like bad news<br>
        I gotta have you<br>
        I gotta have you<br>
