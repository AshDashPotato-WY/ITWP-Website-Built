        <div class="introduction">
            <p>
                In preparation for the Lunar New Year, houses are thoroughly cleaned to rid them of inauspicious
                spirits, which might have collected during the old year. Cleaning is also meant to open space for good
                will and good luck.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some households hold rituals to offer food and paper icons to ancestors. Others post red paper and
                banners inscribed with calligraphy messages of good health and fortune in front of, and inside, homes.
                Elders give out envelopes containing money to children. Foods made from glutinous rice are commonly
                eaten, as these foods represent togetherness. Other foods symbolize prosperity, abundance and good luck.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here are some examples about tranditions that Chinese people are doing during the New Year.

                    <p style="text-align: left;">People give their houses a thorough cleaning before the Spring Festival, which symbolizes
                        sweeping away the bad luck of the preceding year and making their homes ready to receive good
                        luck. Red is the main color for the festival, as red is believed to be an auspicious color for
                        the Lunar New Year, denoting prosperity and energy — which ward off evil spirits and negativity.
                        Red lanterns hang in streets; red couplets and New Year pictures are pasted on doors.

                    <p style="text-align: left;">Lion dances and dragon dances are widely seen in China and Chinatowns in many Western countries
                        during the Lunar New Year period. They are performed to bring prosperity and good luck for the
                        upcoming year or event.
                        There are more Chinese New Year traditions and customs, such as wearing new clothes, staying up
                        late on Chinese New Year's Eve, watching the Spring Festival Gala, etc. </p>

                    <p style="text-align: left;">Chinese New Year (Lunar New Year) is a time for families to be together. Chinese New Year's Eve
                        is the most important time. Wherever they are, people are expected to be home to celebrate the 
                        festival with their families. The Chinese New Year's Eve dinner is called 'reunion dinner'. Big
                        families of several generations sit around round tables and enjoy the food and time together.

                    <p style="text-align: left;">The most common gifts are red envelopes (or red packets, lìshì or lai see in Cantonese). Red
                        envelopes have money in, and are often given to children and (retired) seniors.
                        The red envelope (money) is called ya sui qian (压岁钱 /yaa sway chyen/), which means 'suppressing
                        Sui [the demon]money'. Those who receive a red envelope are wished another safe and peaceful
                        year.

                    <p style="text-align: left;">From public displays in major cities to millions of private celebrations in China's rural areas,
                        setting off firecrackers and fireworks is an indispensable festive activity. It is a way to
                        scare away the evil and welcome the new year's arrival.
                        Billions of fireworks go up in China at 12 am and in the first minutes of Chinese New Year, the
                        most anywhere at any time of year.</p>
