            <br>
            <p>Lunar New Year is one of the most important celebrations of the year among East and Southeast Asian
                cultures, including Chinese, Vietnamese and Korean communities, among others. The New Year celebration is usually
                celebrated for multiple days—not just one day as in the Gregorian calendar's New Year. In 2022, Lunar
                New Year begins on February 1.
            </p>
            <p>
                China's Lunar New Year is known as the Spring Festival or Chūnjié in Mandarin, while Koreans call it
                Seollal and Vietnamese refer to it as Tết.
            </p>
            <p>
                Tied to the lunar calendar, the holiday began as a time for feasting and to honor household and heavenly
                deities, as well as ancestors. The New Year typically begins with the first new moon that occurs between
                the end of January and spans the first 15 days of the first month of the lunar calendar—until the full
                moon arrives.
