                Each culture celebrates the Lunar New Year differently with various foods
                and traditions that symbolize prosperity, abundance and togetherness. This
                page will introduce you four certain foods that Chinese people eat during
                the Lunar New Year for their symbolizing meanings. Along with them, there

                    In Chinese, "fish" (鱼 Yú /yoo/) sounds like 'surplus'. Fish is a traditional
                    Chinese New Year dish on the Chinese New Year dinner menu. Chinese people
                    always like to have a surplus at the end of the year, because they think if
                    they have managed to save something at the end of the year, then they can
                    make more in the next year.

                    With a history of more than 1,800 years, dumpling (饺子 Jiǎozi /jyaoww-dzrr/)
                    is a classic lucky food for Lunar New Year, and a traditional dish eaten on
                    Chinese New Year's Eve, widely popular in China, especially in North China.
                    Chinese dumplings can be made to look like Chinese silver ingots (which are
                    not bars, but boat-shaped, oval, and turned up at the two ends). Legend has
                    it that the more dumplings you eat during the New Year celebrations, the
                    more money you can make in the New Year.

                    Spring rolls (春卷 Chūnjuǎn /chwnn- jwen/) get their name because they are
                    traditionally eaten during the Spring Festival. It is a Chinese New Year
                    dish especially popular in East China: Jiangxi, Jiangsu, Shanghai, Fujian,
                    Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Hong Kong, etc.

                    Sweet rice ball (汤圆 Tāngyuán /tung-ywen/) is the main food for China's
                    Lantern Festival, however, in south China, people eat them throughout
                    the Spring Festival. The pronunciation and round shape of tangyuan are
                    associated with reunion and being together. That's why they are favored
                    by the Chinese during the New Year celebrations.
